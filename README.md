## Overview

This repository is a Python-based project dedicated to acquiring, cleaning, and preparing NBA player data for in-depth analysis, with a primary focus on applications for player prop bet analysis. It provides a structured approach to web scraping, data normalization, and organized storage of player statistics.

## Features

* **Automated Data Acquisition:** Scrapes current and historical NBA player data, including game logs, primarily from basketball-reference.com.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates bar plots for analysis of player performance outcomes, clearly indicating whether results were 'over' or 'under' their respective prop lines.
   
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+ (Recommended)
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Sources
* Basketball-Reference.com: Primary source for NBA player statistics, contract data, and game logs.

## Future Work

* Feature Engineering: Develop functions to create relevant features from raw player statistics for betting models.

* Database Integration: Migrate data storage from CSVs to a more robust database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) using libraries like SQLAlchemy.

* Statistical Analysis & Modeling: Build statistical models to predict player performance and identify potential value in prop bets.

* Visualization: Create informative plots and dashboards to visualize player trends and model insights.

* Automated Pipeline: Set up an end-to-end workflow for daily data updates.
